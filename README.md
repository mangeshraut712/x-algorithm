## 🎯 What This Is

This repository contains a **reference implementation** of the recommendation algorithm that powers X's (formerly Twitter) "For You" timeline, plus **8 interactive tools** to help you understand and optimize for it.

### What You'll Learn

- **The exact scoring weights** used to rank posts
- **How engagement** (likes, retweets, replies) is calculated
- **The multi-stage pipeline** from candidate sourcing to final ranking
- **The "Candidate Isolation" technique** in the Grok-based transformer
