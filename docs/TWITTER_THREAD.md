# 🐦 X Algorithm Twitter Thread Draft

I read the entire X algorithm source code so you don't have to.

Here's EXACTLY how your posts are ranked (with the actual numbers):

The algorithm uses this formula:

Score = Σ (weight × P(action))

Translation: It predicts what people will DO on your post, then weighs each action differently.

Here are the ACTUAL weights from the code:

**Tweet 3**

💬 Reply: 27.0 (HIGHEST)
👤 Profile Click: 12.0
❤️ Like: 1.0
🔁 Retweet: 1.0

A single reply is worth 27 likes.

This is why "engagement bait" that gets likes but no replies performs worse than controversial takes that spark discussion.

But here's where it gets interesting:

NEGATIVE signals exist too.

😴 "Not Interested" = -74.0
🚫 Report = -369.0

Getting 1% of viewers to click "Not Interested" can destroy a post that has 10% like rate.

The algorithm also tracks:

📺 Video Quality View (VQV) - Must watch 2+ seconds
🖼️ Photo Expand - When someone taps to enlarge
⏱️ Dwell time - How long they spend reading

This is why "stop the scroll" content wins.

SimClusters are REAL.

The algorithm groups you into topic clusters based on your engagement history.

If you usually post about tech but suddenly post about cooking:
→ Your cooking post won't match your followers' clusters
→ Near-zero distribution

STAY IN YOUR LANE.

The AuthorDiversityScorer penalizes spam.

Each additional post from you in someone's feed gets a decaying multiplier.

This is why:
✅ 3 high-engagement posts > 20 low-engagement posts
✅ Quality > Quantity
✅ Space your posts 3-4 hours apart

The "link penalty" is real.

The algorithm wants to keep people ON the platform.

External links = potential exit = lower score

Workaround:
→ Put links in bio
→ Say "link in replies"
→ NEVER in the main post

🎯 TL;DR Priority:

1. Create reply-worthy content (27x weight)
2. Make it shareable/DM-worthy
3. Maximize dwell time (stop the scroll)
4. NEVER trigger blocks/mutes (-74 to -369)
5. Stay in your niche (SimClusters)
6. Reply to your comments (author response boost)

I built a Score Calculator so you can predict how your posts will rank:

If this resonates:
- Replies will drive the thread
- Profile clicks will grow your following
- Bookmarks will signal "save for later" value
